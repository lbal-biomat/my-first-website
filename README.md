# My First Website

Welcome to my first webpage!

### Project description

The goal of this project was to learn some php and html as an introduction to web development. 
I achieved data persistence by storing data as json in plain text, which is adequate for the size of this project.
It includes session management, login, logout, signup, etc.
The passwords are salted using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and then hashed with sha512.
The site is styled with CSS and bootstrap.
